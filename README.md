# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Operations

This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart: insufficient error handling in asynchronous functions.  The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote API.  However, it has several flaws:

1. **Generic Exception Handling:** The `catch (e)` block is too broad.  It catches all exceptions without providing specific details, making debugging difficult.
2. **Missing HTTP Status Code Handling:**  The code only checks for `response.statusCode == 200`. It should handle other status codes (e.g., 404, 500) appropriately. 
3. **JSON Decoding Errors:**  The `jsonDecode` function can throw exceptions if the response body is not valid JSON. This is not handled.

The solution provides improved error handling, including specific exception types and logging for better diagnostics.
